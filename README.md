# ML-Predicting-traffic-congestion-in-Sao-Paulo
This is a project that apply some Machine Learning algorithm into data anlysis. 
We used various machine learning techniques and algorithms on a sample data set in order to determine relative performance on the data. With the goal of determining the best solution for this type of data. Naive Bayes, KNN, Linear Regression, SVM, decision tree, Adaboost and Neural Nets were all used to create the comparisons. With the conclusion that Linear Regression was best for this dataset.

# My responsibility 
Implement Naive_Bayes, KNN, Regression and Neural Networks algorithms.
